# You are given operations, an array containing the following two types of operations:
# [0, a, b] - Create and save a rectangle of size a xb:
# [1, a, b] - Answer the question: "Could a box of size ax b fit inside of each of the earlier saved
# rectangles?". It is possible to rotate the rectangles by go degrees; ie: a rectangle of dimensions a xb
# can be rotated so that its dimensions are b x
# IE
# Your task is to return an array of booleans, representing the answers to the second type of operation, in the
# order they appear.
# GS
# Note that the operations should proceed iteratively, so when operations[i] is executed, only the results of
# the previous operations o
# 1
# - 1 are avallable.
# Example
# â€¢ For operations = [[1, 1, 1]], the output should be solution (operations) = [true]
# There are no rectangles, so return true because there were no rectangles that the box was unable to fit
# inside
# For operations = [[0, 100000, 100000]] the output should be solution(operations)
# = 0


operations = [[0, 3, 3], [0, 5, 2], [1, 3, 2], [1, 2, 4]]
